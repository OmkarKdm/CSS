            <p>
                CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets." It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of HTML and XML documents, including their layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. CSS enables web developers to control the appearance of web pages and make them visually appealing and consistent across different devices and screen sizes.

            <h2>Key Features of CSS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Selectors: CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements on which styles will be applied.</li>
                <li>Properties: CSS properties define the specific aspects of an element's appearance.</li>
                <li>Values: CSS properties are assigned values that determine how the elements should look.</li>
                <li>Cascading: CSS follows the principle of cascading, which means that multiple CSS rules can apply to the same HTML element, and the styles are applied in a specific order of precedence.</li>
                <li>External Style Sheets: CSS allows developers to create separate external style sheets in .css files that can be linked to multiple HTML pages.</li>
